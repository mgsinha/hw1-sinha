### Machine Learning Main Ideas

#### Question 1: Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?
As defined by the textbook, supervised learning means that for each observation of the predictor measurement(s) $x_{i}, i = 1,...,n$ there is an associated response measurement $y_{i}$. Unsupervised learning means thatfor each observation of the predictor measurement(s) $x_{i}, i = 1,...,n$ there is no associated response measurement $y_{i}$ which can be slightly more challenging.

#### Question 2: Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.
A regression model is defined by $Y$ being quantitative with numerical values whereas in a classification mode, $Y$ is qualitative with categorical values.
<br>
<br>

#### Question 3: Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.



#### Question 4: As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

Descriptive models:

Inferential models:

Predictive models:

#### Question 5: Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

#### Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?
Both models estimate $f$ in some way. Mechanistic models assume a parametric form for $f$ (i.e. $\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}...$) and won't match true unknown $f$. Empirical models have no assumptions about $f$ (nonparametric), require a larger number of observations, and are more flexible by default.

#### In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.
In general, a mechanistic model is easier to understand because it is less flexible which generally implies higher interpretability. 
<br>
<br>

#### Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.
The bias-variance tradeoff essentially defines an inverse relationship between model flexibility and interpretability. Less flexible models will generally have higher interpretability and more flexible models will have less interpretability. As mentioned above, mechanistic models generally have less flexibility meaning that they will be easier to interpret according to the bias-variance tradeoff, and empirically-driven models will be more difficult to interpret because of higher flexibility.

#### Question 6: A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

#### Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

#### How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

#### Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
You should use the tidyverse and ggplot2 for these exercises.

#### Exercise 1: We are interested in highway miles per gallon, or the hwy variable. Create a histogram of this variable. Describe what you see/learn.

#### Exercise 2: Create a scatterplot. Put hwy on the x-axis and cty on the y-axis. Describe what you notice. Is there a relationship between hwy and cty? What does this mean?

#### Exercise 3: Make a bar plot of manufacturer. Flip it so that the manufacturers are on the y-axis. Order the bars by height. Which manufacturer produced the most cars? Which produced the least?

#### Exercise 4: Make a box plot of hwy, grouped by cyl. Do you see a pattern? If so, what?

#### Exercise 5: Use the corrplot package to make a lower triangle correlation matrix of the mpg dataset. (Hint: You can find information on the package here.)

#### Which variables are positively or negatively correlated with which others? Do these relationships make sense to you? Are there any that surprise you?
